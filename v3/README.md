# cc

Package CC is a C99 compiler front end. Work In Progress. API unstable.

The package will get a go.mod file and a proper repository tag once it becomes reasonably complete and stable.

At the moment the Parse function seems to work.

The bigger missing piece is type checking.

Installation

    $ go get modernc.org/cc/v3
